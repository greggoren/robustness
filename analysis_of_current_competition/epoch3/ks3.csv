The elliptical trainer combines the motion
of stair-stepping with cross-country skiing,
providing a low-impact aerobic workout.
Many elliptical trainers use alternating
push/pull resistance bars to add an upperbody
workout as you stride. The pedals
can also be reversed (backward stride),
which not only works the muscles in a
slightly different manner but allows some
variation in your workout.
There are two main types of elliptical
machines available: rear-drive and frontdrive.
Rear-drive units enable a true
elliptical movement of the pedals and
include an adjustable incline ramp at the
front of the machine. A front-drive elliptical
machine, on the other hand, needs to use
articulating pedals in order to match a
natural stride and lacks the adjustable
ramp of a rear-drive unit. Most users tend
to prefer rear-drive elliptical machines. The
primary advantage of a front-drive unit is
the cost.

No matter what your budget, a chic, high-end wedding can be yours without sacrificing a single iota of style.
Guest List: Invite 100 guests instead of 150 (save on everything). Do the math: If your wedding comes to $100 per person for food and drink, cutting your list from 150 to 100 saves $5,000.
Wedding Style: The less formal the affair, the more affordable. Instead of a sit-down dinner, go for a casual brunch or barbecue. Get rental cars in lieu of limos.
Wedding Invitations: Keep the wedding invitations simple. Remember, top-quality paper, fancy typography techniques and custom-colored inks increase the price, as do decorative envelope linings and multiple enclosures. Choose one fabulous element and keep all the rest simple. Use response postcards or make save-the-date cards yourself. To keep postage costs down, stay away from oversize or overweight styles.

Have a Lowe's customer service associate help you ensure the two components match. Almost any tank you purchase will come with the flush-valve assembly already installed, but it never hurts to check this as well. In addition, you'll need new closet bolts, a wax gasket, and a toilet seat if these aren't included. There are complete kits that include the tank, bowl, wax ring and a hardware kit.

This paper compares the precision and accuracy of five current global positioning system (GPS) receivers—Trimble ProXR, Trimble GeoXT without WAAS, Trimble GeoXT with WAAS, Trimble GeoExplorer II, and an HP/Pharos receiver. Each of these receivers, along with other similar units, are 
frequently used today for data collection and integration within a geographic information system (GIS).  
To compare receivers, we conducted a field study of 15 established survey markers in the City of Pocatello, Idaho. The points were observed on ten different dates with equivalent settings (e.g., averaging and acceptable point dilution of precision—PDOP). Overall, the results indicate that the GeoXT is well suited where sub-meter accuracy is required while the Pharos receiver is a viable alternative for applications with accuracy requirements of +/- 10m and more
