So Initially, I discussed with them the type of wedding they were interested in planning, if it would be a religious or civil wedding, formal or informal and so on.

Following this, the details of the wedding ceremony may be discussed such as, the brides dress, and the suite for the groom, the kinds of foods to be served in the buffet, and the kind of music to be played. Additionally, if the photographer will make magnets that can be taken home.

1. Cut off your guest list: Invite 100 guests instead of 150. Do the math - If your wedding comes to $100 per person for food and drink, cutting your list from 150 to 100 saves $5,000 off your wedding budget.
2. The less formal the affair, the more affordable. Instead of a sit-down dinner, go for a casual brunch or barbecue. 
3.As far as wedding Invitations: Keep them simple. Remember, top-quality paper, fancy typography techniques and custom-colored inks increase the price, but not necessarily worth the extra money. Use response postcards or make save-the-date cards yourself. To keep postage costs down, stay away from oversize or overweight styles.

First is Abscess, an infection of the sensitive tissue of the horse's hoof. Symptoms include the hoof being hot and an increased pulse. The abscess will migrate up the hoof and break out at the coronary band. Abscesses can be located with hoof testers. Avoid cutting a large hole in the hoof when pairing or opening the abscess. In most cases, the less hoof removed, the quicker the horse can recover and return to active use. Another is hoof crack, a visible vertical crack in the hoof wall.

Corns start out as bruises of the sensitive sole in the angle formed by the hoof wall and bars.",horse hooves,,,
