The elliptical trainer combines the motion
of stair-stepping with cross-country skiing,
providing a low-impact aerobic workout.
Many elliptical trainers use alternating
push/pull resistance bars to add an upperbody
workout as you stride. The pedals
can also be reversed (backward stride),
which not only works the muscles in a
slightly different manner but allows some
variation in your workout.
There are two main types of elliptical
machines available: rear-drive and frontdrive.
Rear-drive units enable a true
elliptical movement of the pedals and
include an adjustable incline ramp at the
front of the machine. A front-drive elliptical
machine, on the other hand, needs to use
articulating pedals in order to match a
natural stride and lacks the adjustable
ramp of a rear-drive unit. Most users tend
to prefer rear-drive elliptical machines. The
primary advantage of a front-drive unit is
the cost.

Wilson has long been a trusted name in CB antennas. They have several types of antennas to offer, including the most popular magnet mount antennas on the market.
When it comes to magnet mount antennas, we typically recommend these. Wilson magnetic mount antennas include a strong magnet with a protective coating to protect your vehicle's finish, a high quality coax, and a base loaded coil with a steel whip that creates less drag and keeps the antenna upright. The Little Wil magnet mount CB antenna is one of our most popular antennas. If you need something a little taller we also have the Wilson 1000 and 5000 antennas.

The island of Barbados is located at 13.4ºN and 54.4ºW and is situated in the western area of the North Atlantic Ocean and 100 kilometres east of the Windward Islands and the Caribbean Sea. The island is seen by most scientists as geologically unique as it was formed as a result of an amalgamation of two land masses over a period of many years. The peaceful Arawaks and the more ferocious Caribs were the first inhabitants of Barbados. However, when English Captain, John Powell arrived in 1625, the island was uninhabited and as a result he claimed it for King James I of England. Powell soon returned to England to put the necessary plans in place and subsequently returned to Barbados in February of 1627 at the site which is now known as Holetown.

First things first - there are two main ways to thread your hand sewing needle and both are good for different techniques: 
Single thread: thread your needle but knot only one end so that the other is free to come unthreaded - this is especially useful for embroidery techniques where you might need to quickly and easily unpick a few stitches.
Double thread: thread your needle and knot both ends together - the doubled up thread will make for a more secure stitch, but is impossible to unpick without cutting the thread and starting over!
Good for gathering or ruching fabric to make gathered skirts, basting seams and stay stitching a curved edge to prevent it from stretching. A running stitch looks exactly the same on both sides of the fabric.

This paper compares the precision and accuracy of five current global positioning system (GPS) receivers—Trimble ProXR, Trimble GeoXT without WAAS, Trimble GeoXT with WAAS, Trimble GeoExplorer II, and an HP/Pharos receiver. Each of these receivers, along with other similar units, are 
frequently used today for data collection and integration within a geographic information system (GIS).  
To compare receivers, we conducted a field study of 15 established survey markers in the City of Pocatello, Idaho. The points were observed on ten different dates with equivalent settings (e.g., averaging and acceptable point dilution of precision—PDOP). Overall, the results indicate that the GeoXT is well suited where sub-meter accuracy is required while the Pharos receiver is a viable alternative for applications with accuracy requirements of +/- 10m and more

The island of Barbados is located at 13.4ºN and 54.4ºW and is situated in the western area of the North Atlantic Ocean and 100 kilometres east of the Windward Islands and the Caribbean Sea. The island is seen by most scientists as geologically unique as it was formed as a result of an amalgamation of two land masses over a period of many years. The peaceful Arawaks and the more ferocious Caribs were the first inhabitants of Barbados. However, when English Captain, John Powell arrived in 1625, the island was uninhabited and as a result he claimed it for King James I of England. Powell soon returned to England to put the necessary plans in place and subsequently returned to Barbados in February of 1627 at the site which is now known as Holetown.

First things first - there are two main ways to thread your hand sewing needle and both are good for different techniques: 
Single thread: thread your needle but knot only one end so that the other is free to come unthreaded - this is especially useful for embroidery techniques where you might need to quickly and easily unpick a few stitches.
Double thread: thread your needle and knot both ends together - the doubled up thread will make for a more secure stitch, but is impossible to unpick without cutting the thread and starting over!
Good for gathering or ruching fabric to make gathered skirts, basting seams and stay stitching a curved edge to prevent it from stretching. A running stitch looks exactly the same on both sides of the fabric.

No matter what your budget, a chic, high-end wedding can be yours without sacrificing a single iota of style.
Guest List: Invite 100 guests instead of 150 (save on everything). Do the math: If your wedding comes to $100 per person for food and drink, cutting your list from 150 to 100 saves $5,000.
Wedding Style: The less formal the affair, the more affordable. Instead of a sit-down dinner, go for a casual brunch or barbecue. Get rental cars in lieu of limos.
Wedding Invitations: Keep the wedding invitations simple. Remember, top-quality paper, fancy typography techniques and custom-colored inks increase the price, as do decorative envelope linings and multiple enclosures. Choose one fabulous element and keep all the rest simple. Use response postcards or make save-the-date cards yourself. To keep postage costs down, stay away from oversize or overweight styles.

Overall, the results indicate that the GeoXT is well suited where sub-meter accuracy is required while the Pharos receiver is a viable alternative for applications with accuracy requirements of +/- 10m and more

Looking for Internet service on the cheap? You can look for deals from the major ISPs, like Comcast's recent roll-out of discount service for low-income families, but keep in mind that you may not qualify under the terms of such programs.
Never fear—there are still plenty of options for low-priced and even free Internet service available to all comers. Of course, some of those ISPs provide service with a catch. For example, you may have to accept time limits on your monthly browsing, go without high-speed access or pay a premium for it, and in the case of some offers, service is only available in specific regions or metropolitan areas.
So why would anyone provide free or ultra-cheap Internet service, anyway? What's in it for them? You might be surprised to learn that a decade ago, there were dozens of ISPs providing free service.

Looking for Internet service on the cheap? You can look for deals from the major ISPs, like Comcast's recent roll-out of discount service for low-income families, but keep in mind that you may not qualify under the terms of such programs.
Never fear—there are still plenty of options for low-priced and even free Internet service available to all comers. Of course, some of those ISPs provide service with a catch. For example, you may have to accept time limits on your monthly browsing, go without high-speed access or pay a premium for it, and in the case of some offers, service is only available in specific regions or metropolitan areas.
So why would anyone provide free or ultra-cheap Internet service, anyway? What's in it for them? You might be surprised to learn that a decade ago, there were dozens of ISPs providing free service.

First things first - there are two main ways to thread your hand sewing needle and both are good for different techniques: 
Single thread: thread your needle but knot only one end so that the other is free to come unthreaded - this is especially useful for embroidery techniques where you might need to quickly and easily unpick a few stitches.
Double thread: thread your needle and knot both ends together - the doubled up thread will make for a more secure stitch, but is impossible to unpick without cutting the thread and starting over!
Good for gathering or ruching fabric to make gathered skirts, basting seams and stay stitching a curved edge to prevent it from stretching. A running stitch looks exactly the same on both sides of the fabric.
