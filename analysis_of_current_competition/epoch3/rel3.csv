The elliptical trainer combines the motion
of stair-stepping with cross-country skiing,
providing a low-impact aerobic workout.
Many elliptical trainers use alternating
push/pull resistance bars to add an upperbody
workout as you stride. The pedals
can also be reversed (backward stride),
which not only works the muscles in a
slightly different manner but allows some
variation in your workout.
There are two main types of elliptical
machines available: rear-drive and frontdrive.
Rear-drive units enable a true
elliptical movement of the pedals and
include an adjustable incline ramp at the
front of the machine. A front-drive elliptical
machine, on the other hand, needs to use
articulating pedals in order to match a
natural stride and lacks the adjustable
ramp of a rear-drive unit. Most users tend
to prefer rear-drive elliptical machines. The
primary advantage of a front-drive unit is
the cost.

frequently used today for data collection and integration within a geographic information system (GIS).  
To compare receivers, we conducted a field study of 15 established survey markers in the City of Pocatello, Idaho. The points were observed on ten different dates with equivalent settings (e.g., averaging and acceptable point dilution of precision—PDOP). Overall, the results indicate that the GeoXT is well suited where sub-meter accuracy is required while the Pharos receiver is a viable alternative for applications with accuracy requirements of +/- 10m and more

Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem.
