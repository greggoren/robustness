The less formal the affair, the more affordable. Instead of a sit-down dinner, go for a casual brunch or barbecue.
As far as wedding Invitations: Keep them simple. Remember, top-quality paper, fancy typography techniques and custom-colored inks increase the price, but not necessarily worth the extra money.
