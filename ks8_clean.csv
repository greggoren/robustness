Each of these receivers, along with other similar units, are frequently used today for data collection and integration within a Geographic Information System = ""GIS"".
There is a trade-off between sub-meter accuracy and accuracy requirements of 10 meters and more.
To compare GPS receivers, we conducted a field study of 15 established survey markers in the City of Pocatello, Idaho.
The points were observed on ten different dates with equivalent settings(e.g. PDOP).
Overall, the results indicate that the GeoXT (""https://seafloorsystems.com/products/product/trimble-geoxt-handheld-gps-receiver/category_pathway-26"") is well suited where sub-meter accuracy is required while the Pharos receiver (""https://pharos.com/"") is a viable alternative for applications with accuracy requirements of +/- 10m and more.",gps,,,
